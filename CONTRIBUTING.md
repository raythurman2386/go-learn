## üìö Adding New Lessons

The Go Learning Environment supports adding new lessons to expand the learning content. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Lesson Structure

Each lesson consists of three main components:

```go
type Lesson struct {
    Title       string   // Display name of the lesson
    Explanation string   // Brief explanation text
    Example     string   // Code example
    ProblemFile string   // Path to practice problem file
    TestCmd     []string // Command to test the solution
}
```

### Step 2: Create the Lesson File

1. **Create a new lesson file** in `internal/lessons/`:
   ```
   internal/lessons/N_topic_lesson.go
   ```
   Where `N` is the next lesson number and `topic` is a descriptive name.

2. **Implement the lesson constructor**:
   ```go
   package lessons

   func TopicLesson() Lesson {
       return Lesson{
           Title: "Your Topic Title",
           Explanation: `Your explanation text here.
           This should be educational and concise.`,
           Example: `package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       // Your example code here
       fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
   }`,
           ProblemFile: "internal/problems/N_topic.go",
           TestCmd: []string{"go", "run", "internal/problems/N_topic.go"},
       }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Practice Problem

1. **Create a problem file** in `internal/problems/`:
   ```
   internal/problems/N_topic.go
   ```

2. **Write a practice problem**:
   ```go
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       // TODO: Implement your solution here
       // This file should contain a coding challenge
       // that teaches the lesson topic

       fmt.Println("Implement me!")
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Register the Lesson

1. **Open** `internal/lessons/lessons.go`
2. **Add your lesson** to the `initializeLessons()` function:
   ```go
   func initializeLessons() {
       lessons["1"] = VariablesLesson()
       lessons["2"] = SlicesLesson()
       // ... existing lessons ...
       lessons["17"] = TopicLesson() // Add your new lesson
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Test Your Lesson

1. **Build and run** the application:
   ```bash
   go run ./cmd
   ```

2. **Navigate** to your new lesson
3. **Test all options**: Explain, Example, Solve Problem
4. **Verify** the problem runs and provides feedback

### Lesson Guidelines

- **Progressive Difficulty**: Ensure lessons build upon previous knowledge
- **Clear Objectives**: Each lesson should have a specific learning goal
- **Practical Examples**: Include real-world applicable code
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Cover common use cases and pitfalls
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Write explanations for learners new to Go

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow the [official Go style guide](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
- Use `gofmt` to format your code
- Run `go vet` to check for common issues
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

Examples:
```
Add new lesson on error handling
Fix panic in lesson navigation
Update README with better installation instructions
```

### File Organization

- Keep lesson files organized by topic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related functionality together
- Add package comments for new files

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/lessons
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new functionality
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include edge cases

Example test structure:
```go
func TestLessonCreation(t *testing.T) {
    lesson := NewLesson()

    if lesson.Title == "" {
        t.Error("Lesson title should not be empty")
    }

    // Add more test cases...
}
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure** your code builds and tests pass:
   ```bash
   go build ./cmd
   go test ./...
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if needed (README, comments, etc.)

3. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title describing the changes
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues

4. **Wait for review** and address any feedback

5. **Merge** once approved
